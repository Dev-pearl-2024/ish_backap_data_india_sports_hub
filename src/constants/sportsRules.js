                                               - The basic unit of scoring is the "point." 
                                            
                                               - Points are scored in increments of 15, with the sequence being 15, 30, 40. The first point won is 15, the second is 30, the third is 40, and winning a fourth point gives the player the game. 
                                            
                                               - If both players or teams have won three points each (40-40), it's called "deuce." From deuce, a player must win two consecutive points to win the game. The first point won after deuce is referred to as "advantage." If the player with advantage wins the next point, they win the game. If they lose the point, it goes back to deuce.

                                               - To win a game, a player must win four points and have at least a two-point advantage over their opponent. If the score reaches 40-40 (deuce), the game continues until one player has a two-point advantage.

                                               - To win a set, a player must be the first to reach six games, and they must have a margin of at least two games over their opponent. 
                                            
                                               - If the set reaches a 6-6 tie, a tiebreaker may be played (depends on the tournament rules). In a tiebreaker, players take turns serving, and the first player to reach at least seven points with a margin of two points wins the tiebreaker and the set.

                                                 - Forehand and backhand strokes are fundamental; forehand hits with the front hand, and backhand with the back of the hand. 
                                               
                                                 - In the rear court, players prefer forehands, avoiding backhand overheads due to limited power.

                                                 - Stroke choice depends on shuttlecock proximity to the net, height, and opponent position. 
                                               
                                                 - Forecourt involves net kills or dropping shuttlecock just over the net; midcourt uses powerful smashes. 
                                               
                                                 - Rearcourt focuses on overhead hits for smashes, clears, and drop shots.

                                                 - Slicing imparts spin for deception; sliced shots follow a curved path or tumble, enhancing unpredictability. 
                                               
                                                 - Shuttlecock's natural spin affects strokes, with tumbling net shots being more effective in certain slicing directions.

                                                 - Backhand is often preferred for returning smashes, covering the body effectively.

                                                 - Deceptive techniques involve making opponents believe in a different stroke or delaying their movement. 
                                               
                                                 - Players use double motion and varied racquet movements to confuse opponents and gain a competitive advantage.
